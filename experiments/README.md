# Experiments based on roco2_kernels

This directory contains different experiments implemented
using [exomat](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/exomat).

## scaling/

Executes every roco2 kernel for 20 seconds, continuously recording
power consumption.

This can be used for judging the changes in power consumption behavior of the
roco2 kernels over time.
This is useful for deciding on a roco2 runtime that is small enough to allow fast experimentation while allowing for stable power consumption readings.
